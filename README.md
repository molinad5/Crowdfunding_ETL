### Project 2: Crowdfunding ETL

A collaborative initiative to develop an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, QuickDBD, and PostgreSQL for processing crowdfunding data extracted from Excel files and loading it into a relational database.

### **Overview**

This project involved creating an ETL pipeline to handle crowdfunding data stored in Excel files. The process included extracting and transforming the data, generating four CSV files, designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and table schema, and importing the CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.

### **Key Features**

- Extract and transform crowdfunding and contact data from Excel files.
- Generate and export CSV files for Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contact datasets.
- Develop an ERD and corresponding database table schema with QuickDBD.
- Create and populate PostgreSQL database tables with the processed data

### **How to Use**

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to extract, transform, and convert the data into CSV files.
2. Create the schema with QuickDBD.
3. Load the CSV files into their respective PostgreSQL tables.
4. Query the database to ensure the data has been successfully imported.
